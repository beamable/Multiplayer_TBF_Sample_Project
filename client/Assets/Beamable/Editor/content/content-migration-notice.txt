# Beamable Content Migration Notice
On 2025-11-05T10:30:22, the content was migrated from Unity Scriptable Object 
representation to raw JSON representation. The content now lives in the .beamable/content folder
for this project. 

If you go to the new Beamable Content Manager, and no longer see the Migration 
workflow, then you may safely delete the Assets/Beamable/Editor/content folder.
